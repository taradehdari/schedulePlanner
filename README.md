I have created a simple work day calendar scheduler. It goes from 8am-10pm.

For my calendar when you press the save button the tasks stay even when the page refreshes. 

The past hours stay the torqouise color, the present hour is a bright red, and the future hours are a bright green color. 

Here is a screenshot of my website:
